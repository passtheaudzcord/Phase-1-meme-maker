# Phase-1-meme-maker

In our app, The Meme App, users can create personalized memes by selecting from popular options and adding custom top and bottom text through our intuitive interface.

The API we will be using to grab memes for our app is https://apimeme.com/?ref=apilist.fun

Three unique event listeners we will be using are:
- We will be using ‘submit’ for users so they are able to submit text onto the images and        submit their own images. We will also be using ‘submit’ for our generate option and our download option.
- We will be using ‘click’ for users to select memes from our preview options, or they can select from our dropdown menu with all memes listed. 
- We will be using ‘reset’ after the user creates the meme they want, so that the textboxes and image resets.

We will be using array iteration to iterate over every meme from the meme api.

Our three stretch goals are:
- Add gifs 
- Videos 
- Let users add their own photos or videos
